This project focuses on gender recognition using human voice. It adopts a comprehensive approach that combines both machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.

## Project Objectives

- Gender recognition using acoustic features of voice samples.
- Data exploration and visualization.
- Utilization of both traditional machine learning and deep learning models.

## Data

The dataset used in the project is comprised of features of human voice. It consists of acoustic features (frequency, sound intensity, etc.) along with gender labels.

## Algorithms Used

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gauss Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Feedback

If you have any feedback or suggestions regarding the project, please feel free to reach out. I am open to any contributions and insights.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to all the resources used in the project and everyone who provided support.
